# Shape Detection and Classification using OpenCV

This project is a Python-based computer vision system that detects and classifies geometric shapes in an image using OpenCV. It identifies contours, categorizes them (triangle, square, rectangle, circle, or irregular), and annotates the image with useful information like area and object ID.

## üîç Features

- Edge detection using Canny
- Contour detection and filtering
- Shape classification based on number of sides and circularity
- Area calculation for each shape
- Identification of smallest and largest shapes
- Annotated output image with shape info

## üñºÔ∏è Example Output

- Annotated shapes with labels and IDs
- Count of detected shapes
- Highlighted smallest and largest objects
